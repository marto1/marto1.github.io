                    night and came across something of considerable
                    interest. A (board) game called Hex that has some
                    really interesting properties. Apparently the game
                    itself sold quite well in Denmark. Here is a small
                    prototype of the game:</p><h2 id='game' class='paraheading'>Game</h2><canvas id='glCanvas' width='280' height='320'></canvas><h2 id='usage' class='paraheading'>Usage</h2><p class='reading'>The game is played in turns with two players.
                    The red player's objective is to create a path
                    of hexagons from the top of the board to the
                    bottom. The blue player's objective is to do the
                    same, but with his own left to right path. Whoever
                    reaches this objective first wins. It is 
                    mathematically proven there are no ties.</p><h2 id='side_note(idea_for_a_future_rant)' class='paraheading'>Side note(idea for a future rant)</h2><p class='reading'>There are considerable holes in Javascript
                    regarding array handling and string handling
                    of which a metric ton of programming is
                    done. I'm very hopeful of web assembly which
                    should provide a much more consistent experience
                    as it's not as "smart" as javascript. Not to
                    mention implementing more demanding games would
                    more or less require it.</p><script src='/static/hex.js'></script><div class='footer'><p class='reading'>© Copyright 2018 Martin Gergov.
