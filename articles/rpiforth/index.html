	       the raspberry pi platform and ARM in general. I've had
	       this raspberry pi lying around for ~5 years and never
	       really did anything interesting with it. Now that I had
	       some time I decided to poke at it. This one is a
	       classic exploration project - building a forth
	       interpreter. Now I could've gone with compiling gforth
	       on a ready made Arch distro, but that wouldn't have
	       been much fun - so the condition was to make the
	       interpreter without using an OS during runtime. Also no
	       dynamic memory in the core implementation.</p><h2 id='getting_started' class='paraheading'>Getting started</h2><p class='reading'>I think the easiest way to get started with this
	       is to get [pretty much any] image of a distro meant for
	       the RPI like Raspbian or Arch. then you replace the
	       kernel.img file in the boot partition with your program
	       - that's it! This will make the bootloader load your
	       program instead of the Linux kernel. You can find many
	       examples of programs <a href='https://github.com/dwelch67/raspberrypi'>here</a>. The uart02 example was
	       particularly interesting, because it involved
	       read/write communication with the UART headers on the
	       RPI shown on pic below.</p><li style='list-style-type: none;'><div><img style='max-height: 400px; max-width: 500px;' src='/static/images/pi/pi.jpg' /><br /><p class='reading'>Headers 14,15. If you
		   have serial to usb converter connect RPI Rx to Tx
		   and RPI Tx to Rx. Don't forget to also connect
		   ground(GND).</p></div></li><p class='reading'>After you get your blinker examples running make
	       sure to also try the uart02 example, we're building on
	       top of this.</p><h2 id='building_the_loop' class='paraheading'>Building the loop</h2><p class='reading'><a href='https://github.com/marto1/raspforth/blob/master/forth.c#L249'>Here</a> you can see the entire (not)main of the
	       program. It contains initialization of the pins, UART
	       registers and word buffers for the words we're going to
	       consume via UART. Nothing really interesting here. Just
	       read poll for characters from the Rx pin and put them
	       in a buffer. A word is ended by the escape character -
	       in this case a space - and the word is handled by the <b>handle_word</b> function.</p><h2 id='note_on_get32' class='paraheading'>Note on GET32</h2><p class='reading'>Obviously GET32 gets 32 bits at a time which makes
	       4 chars(bytes) per iteration. We're not going for top
	       input performance here so only 1 char per call is
	       actually processed. In more demanding cases this we can
	       easily get 4x performance from here. Other than that
	       there is rewriting this bit in assembly, using a mask
	       and so on, but that's not the point of the article so
	       we'll skip that.</p><h2 id='linenoise_under_construction' class='paraheading'>Linenoise under construction</h2><p class='reading'>Tried using the excellent linenoise library to get
	       more comfortable input experience. There is a trimmed
	       version now <a href='https://github.com/marto1/raspforth/blob/master/linenoise.c'>https://github.com/marto1/raspforth/blob/master/linenoise.c</a>. It has no hints, the history doesn't allocate memory at
	       runtime and a lot of other small things have been
	       trimmed off. It still uses dynamic memory at some
	       places and there is the dependency on termios so it's
	       not ready for prime time, yet. Overall it's at least
	       50%~ smaller now so that's nice.</p><h2 id='building_the_forth' class='paraheading'>Building the forth</h2><p class='reading'>Handling words splits them in two cases - numbers
	       and symbols. Numbers are numerical constants like
	       123123 and are directly pushed on the stack. Scanning
	       them and confirming they are numbers is kind of tricky
	       and hard to do very fast. The first char is scanned for
	       0-9,+,- case and if it doesn't fit that it is
	       definately not a number, otherwise the total length is
	       checked - 10 is the limit for numbers here by
	       default. And only then is the word scanned
	       back-to-forth to confirm it's a number. This makes
	       detecting symbols pretty fast but number scanning is a
	       O(N) operation always.</p><h2 id='types' class='paraheading'>Types</h2><p class='reading'>There is a very small type system builtin that
	       keeps account of the type of each word on the
	       stack. It's a unsigned long long number that will set a
	       bit signifying the type of the word - 0 for symbols and
	       1 for numbers. This comes in handy for processing user
	       defined functions and/or various optimizations.</p><h2 id='operations' class='paraheading'>Operations</h2><p class='reading'>Implemented operations are +, -, *, /, dup and
	       swap; dup and swap are 'd' and 's' respectively. Also
	       . will pop and print from the stack. It feels like it
	       needs a few more operations to make it
	       turing-complete. I'll have to dig more to find the bare
	       minimum.</p><h2 id='conclusion' class='paraheading'>Conclusion</h2><p class='reading'>Turns out it's really easy to get started with
	       programming the rasperry pi bare metal. Interpreters
	       are fun to implement. There are tradeoffs to be made
	       even in the very beginning of building one. You can do
	       very simple stuff like:</p><p class='quotebash'>1 d + 2 *</p><p class='reading'>There are some other applications that would be
	       interesting to do like dos+nintendo emulator, but will
	       see if it's even worth it. Besides that there is quite
	       a bit of periphery on the RPI so there might be
	       projects with that also.</p><div class='footer'><p class='reading'>© Copyright 2018 Martin Gergov.
