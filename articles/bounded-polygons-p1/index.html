                    efficient alghorithms for graphics creation. In
                    particular creating bounded polygons. That is -
                    polygons where the beginning ties to the end
                    and lines don't cross(so you don't have areas with
                    0 area). To this we add 2 other constraints -
                    we construct them from lines with equal fixed length
                    and we allow only 90 degree angles. The end goal is
                    to come up with a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression'>closed form</a> formula for producing
                    polygons of any N lines. 
                    Also we are working in the 2d plain.
                    Here are some examples of
                    what I am talking about:<li style='list-style-type: none;'><div><img style='max-height: 400px; max-width: 500px;' src='/static/images/polygons/exmp1.png' /><br /><p class='reading'>Top row contains only invalid polygons.
                        From left to right 1st one is not bounded,
                        2nd contains angles different than 90 degrees
                        and 3rd has is made up of lines of unequal
                        length. The bottom row is valid. 1st one
                        is made up of 4 equal lines(square) and the
                        second one of 8 equal lines.</p></div></li></p><h2 id='l-systems' class='paraheading'>L-systems</h2><p class='reading'>The current alghorithm is relatively simple.  We
                    start out by introducing a abstraction on top of
                    the target polygons so that we leave geometric
                    space and enter algebraic space.  In this case a
                    L-system or Lindenmayer system is a very neat
                    abstract language for describing patterns. We have
                    an initial sequence called an axiom. For example
                    we can have the sequence ABC. Each letter is an
                    action that does something like A can mean push a
                    button, B can be trigger water irrigation. C can
                    mean create AB in next step so we'll have ABAB in
                    second generation. This "replication" is called
                    a rule. A rule determains if an action, when
                    processed will rewrite itself with another set of
                    actions. This is very useful for describing
                    organic compositions such a nature-looking tree or
                    flower petals, etc. In our case we have a very
                    simple alphabet consisting of F, R and L. F draws
                    a line in the given direction(direction defaults
                    to 3 o'clock), R turns direction 90 degrees to the
                    right, L turns direction 90 degrees to the left.
                    So we can have:</p><p class='quotebash'>FRFRFRF</p><p class='reading'>We draw line forward, turn to the right, draw, etc.
                    until we get a square. This axiom meets all our 
                    constraints. This is how the target polygon should
                    "look" like.</p><h2 id='algorithm' class='paraheading'>Algorithm</h2><p class='reading'>The first very important observation is that for
                    each line drawn we can take a decision to flip
                    direction. So for example if we take our square
                    example we can have F_F_F_F for n=4 we have n-1
                    placeholders that can have R,L or nothing(denoted
                    with _ here). So for N lines polygons we generate
                    the product of all possible combinations of n-1
                    _,R,L like so:</p><p class='quotebash'>list(product("_RL", repeat=4))</p><p class='reading'>which will produce things like ('_', '_', '_')
                    which will produce a straight line of length 4 on
                    the screen. Not a valid polygon. Another one is
                    the familiar ('R', 'R', 'R') which makes a
                    square. We obviously need to filter the valid
                    cases from invalid ones. To do that we traverse
                    all actions for an axiom and detect if the beginning
                    will match with the end. We also keep a record of
                    positions and track to not have the same ones 
                    (except the initial one) which constitutes a cross
                    To trace them we create a virtual coordinate system
                    with initial coordinates 0,0. When traversing we
                    keep track of the current coordinates and history
                    for cross detection. So with FRFRFRF we have 
                    0,0 → 1,0 → 1,-1 → 0,-1 → 0,0. Beginning
                    matches the end and we don't have repeating
                    coordinates so this one stays in the final set.</p><p class='reading'>Second observation is you cannot have a bounded
                    polygon made up of odd number of equal length lines
                    with 90 degree angles only.</p><h2 id='demo' class='paraheading'>Demo</h2><p class='reading'>You can check out the project <a href='https://github.com/marto1/pylsystem'>here</a>. Also here is a video of 
                     generating polygons for n=12:</p><a href='https://gfycat.com/ScalyFrankBasil' rel='nofollow'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marto1/pylsystem/master/polygon_holder.jpg' alt='polygon video' style='max-width:100%;' /></a><h2 id='future' class='paraheading'>Future</h2><p class='reading'>There is still filtering for symmetric shapes.
                    So for example FRFRFRF and FLFLFLF are equivalent
                    and only one of them should remain in the final
                    set. Also there is compressing the whole thing down
                    to a closed form expression. Hopefully in Part 2.</p><h2 class='sharebuttons heading'><span>share:<a href='https://twitter.com/share?url=https://marto1.github.io/articles/bounded-polygons-p1/'>[twitter]</a><a href='https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://marto1.github.io/articles/bounded-polygons-p1/'>[reddit]</a><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://marto1.github.io/articles/bounded-polygons-p1/'>[linkedin]</a><a href='https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://marto1.github.io/articles/bounded-polygons-p1/'>[g+]</a></span></h2><div class='footer'><p class='reading'>© Copyright 2018 Martin Gergov.
